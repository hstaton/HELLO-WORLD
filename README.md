# HELLO-WORLD
Intro
I am new to 3-D creations, but have been a 2D CAD user for many years. I have recently obtained a Flashforge Creator Pro and have found it be an almost magical device. My goal for this year is to build a laser-cutter and 3D lasaer scanner. My main interests lie in Experimental Aviation, R/C sailboats, and CAD.
